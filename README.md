# WordPress Clean up #

##Why?
This plugin exist because i got tired of copying my customizations on WordPress to every project.

##How?
On activation the plugin creates a file named WpCleanUpConfig.php in your current theme. The file consists of a config-array with the possibility to clean up WordPress without anny manual work.

##Configuration

##TODO
- Add better standard config for the boilerplate-file.
